%
% eps_data -> eps h5 datafile. Input the name of your eps h5 file in quotes
% ex: "straight_waveguide_recreate-eps-000000.00.h5"
%
% slice -> 'x', 'y', or 'z' slice of data you want to take. This combined with
% slice num is like chosing a plane that goes through a specified point.
% For example if slice = 'x' and slice_num = 37 then you are selecting the
% yz plane which cuts through x = 37.
%
% slice_num -> The value to which the "slice" variable will be assigned.
% e.g. if slice = 'y' and slice_num = 53 then the plane that satisfies 
% y = 53 will be shown
%
% resolution -> The value of the resolution which the simulation was run in
% meep. Used to calculate the size (in um) of the dimensions. If the refrence
% dimension is not 1 um, you can change the hardcoded um dimension in the 
% bottom switch case for now.
